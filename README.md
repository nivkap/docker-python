# about docker-python repo

This repository contains the image documentation for a docker container I built.

The container has 2 main rolls: 
1. print "python - My container is online"
2. print the first 50 members of Fibonacci sequence
                                 
In the repository you will find 2 files: Dockerfile and PYTHONapp.py.

# Dockerfile:

FROM - creates a layer from the node:alpine Docker image.

COPY - adds files from your Docker clientâ€™s current directory.

CMD - specifies what command to run within the container.

 # PYTHONapp.py
 
 This file is a standart python application that contains the code that responsible for the container's rolls. 
 
 # How to use this container ?
 
 I've uploaded the container's image to dockerhub so you can use it easily.
 
 In order to pull and run this image you'll need a dockerhub account and install docker on your computer.
 
 After doing so, enter *"docker run nivkap/niv-docker-repo:python"* to your terminal and run it.
 
 This command pulls the image from dockerhub and runs it on your computer. 
 
 # result

 As we can see, the program works exactly as we wanted and performs both rolls as mentioned above.
